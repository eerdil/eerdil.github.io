I am working as a postdoctoral researcher in [Biomedical Image Computing (BMIC)](https://bmic.ee.ethz.ch/) group in the [Computer Vision Lab. (CVL)](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/), ETH Zurich, Switzerland.

**Research Interests**


**Short Bio**

I joined ETH Zurich in June 2019. Prior to this, I was working as a Senior Research Engineer in [ARM Ltd.](https://www.arm.com/) where I was developing hardware-efficient image processing methods for improving image quality in mobile displays. In 2017, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Computer Science and Engineering department, [Sabanci University](https://sabanciuniv.edu), Turkey under the supervision of [Prof. Mujdat Cetin](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/people/faculty/cetin_mujdat/). During my Ph.D., I worked on developing Bayesian methods for object segmentation by exploiting nonparametric shape priors.
